# Contributing

ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for your interest in contributing to the WIP app! Iâ€™m glad you're here and excited to help you get started if you have any questions. For now, here are some basic instructions for how I manage this project.

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Local setup

Setup the repository

```
git clone git@github.com:wip/app.git wip-app
cd wip-app
npm install
```

Run the tests

```
npm test
```

If you see an error than something is wrong with the setup. Usually the error message and some research online should be enough to resolve it. But if you canâ€™t figure it out please create an issue and Iâ€™ll try to help you out.

## Build your own

Once the setup looks good, you can follow the Probot documentation to [create and configure your own GitHub app](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configuring-a-github-app).

## Reporting a bug

If you run into a problem with the app, please create an issue describing how to reproduce it. Ideally you will be able to create an automated test that reproduces the problem. You can start a pull request with just a failing test, we can then collaborate on resolving the problem.

## Suggesting a new feature

Note that the WIP is simple by design. Iâ€™m sure there are plenty of features that could be added with just a little bit of code. But in most cases we probably wonâ€™t add it to the WIP itself. But please suggest it anyway, we can have a discussion and maybe you can create your own application with additional features and WIP some users might be interested in using it instead of WIP. Iâ€™d be happy to mention your app in the README.md once we have a few "forks" that are worth mentioning.

## Maintainers: deploying WIP (Beta)

1. Update `now.json`

2. Update `deploy.sh` if you plan to continously deploy from GitHub. Not needed when only deploying locally
